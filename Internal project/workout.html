          Before each fitness session, you should at least have a 5-minute warm-up by proceeding with the exercise but with less intensity and gradually building up until the ideal intensity. During the workout, you should be able to hold a conversation without running out of breath and heart rate should be elevated.
          <br><br>On the days where you don’t do a cardio workout (a rest day), you can incorporate a flexibility routine into the day which should have the same importance as the workouts itself. You can check out the flexibility section on our website for more info. 
          <br><br>You can begin the first few weeks with the same workout load, until you feel confident and comfortable with it, you can increase either the duration or intensity. You can do this based on your own feeling, just until you are doing a workout relevant to your level. When you feel confident in the beginner workout plan and feel that it doesn’t challenge you enough, you can move on to the intermediate cardio fitness plans. 
          <br><br>Example weekly plans (You can adjust the days according to your personal availability and doesn’t have to be exact, just spacing out workouts in a way):
          <br><br>Mon - Rest
          <br>Tuesday – 20 mins brisk walking

          <br><em>How it works:</em>
          <br>Perform each exercise for 3 sets of 8-12 repetitions, with about a minute rest between sets, 3-5 times a week. Ensure that you use a suitable weight which is challenging for you, and you are almost going to failure after each set. Also could try use a heavier weight and do less reps for hypertrophy. It is effective to split your workouts between specific upper body and lower body workouts between different days. 
          
          <br><br>Upper Body Strength Workout

            Cardiovascular fitness or aerobic exercise is a type of physical fitness which elevates the rate at which your heart beats over a duration by including rhythmic and continuous movements. <br><br>
            <br><b>What are the benefits?</b><br><br>Cardio fitness is an excellent way to improve your cardiovascular system, which basically means strengthening your heart and lungs, improving blood circulation through your body, and enhancing the ability to transport oxygen and nutrients to your muscle tissues. Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death in the world, so beginning and maintaining a cardio fitness routine is an excellent way to greatly reduce the risk. <br><br>
            <b>How is a beginner defined?</b><br><br>You would fit into the beginner category if you have not had much experience in cardiovascular fitness/fitness in general or generally feel that you lack physical activity in your life and want to begin training. As a beginner, we recommend starting off small and to gradually build up on your intensity. For example, start off with just a light walk, and then start jogging after a few sessions for a running plan, gradually increasing the speed or duration. <br><br>
            <b>Is a warm-up and cooldown needed?</b><br><br>Yes a warm-up and cooldown are very important parts of a workout. A great way to warm up before a cardiovascular exercise is to begin with light intensity of the exercise and then gradually building up the intensity until the ideal workout intensity. This means that your heart rate will steadily increase, not having a sudden rise, which will greatly reduce the risk of injury and provide you with the most effective benefits. Doing some dynamic stretching (using repeated muscle movements to stretch the range of motion) is also a great way to warm up your muscles and promotes blood flow to ensure enough oxygen can reach your muscles. But static stretching (holding a stretch) is not an effective way to warm up as it does not warm up your muscles well and may reduce temporary range of motion as it is a relaxation stretch. <br><br>
            Adding a flexibility routine on days you don’t workout provides you with many benefits such as reducing muscle tension for recovery which improves your performance in following workouts, reduces risk of injury, and enhances your body’s range of motion. This doesn’t have to be for very long, just a quick 10 minute stretch is also effective. This can also be done as a cooldown after a workout. Check out the flexibility section on our website for more info. 
            <br><br><b>Further tips:</b><br><br>
            •	Make sure you stay hydrated and fuel up before a run to provide your body with more energy and nutrients. <br><br>
            •	Invest in a good pair of supportive shoes for running to prevent injuries. <br><br>
            •	Make sure you get enough rest after workouts, don’t do many workouts in consecutive days and try to space them out across the week. <br><br>
            •	Lastly, listen to your body, if you feel any unexpected pain, dizziness or shortness of breath, stop and rest. 
            <br><br><b>Definitions</b>
            <br><br><u>Intensity</u>
            <br>Intensity is how hard your body is working during exercise. How hard you are breathing, your heart rate and the amount of sweat are factors to measure the intensity. 
            <br><br>Low intensity – you can talk during exercise, not sweating or breathing hard although heart rate is slightly elevated. 
            <br><br>Moderate intensity – you can still talk during exercise, but is more difficult to do so, slightly sweating, slightly out of breath
            <br><br>High intensity – You can only speak a few words at a time, excessive sweating, and heart beats rapidly
            <br><br><u>Duration</u>
            <br>Refers to the length of your workout and how long it lasts, usually around 10 mins to an hour depending on the type of cardio
            <br><br><u>Frequency</u>
            <br>Means how often you workout within a week or day, usually 1-5 days a week.

            <br><br><b>How is intermediate defined?</b><br><br>You would fit into this intermediate category if you have had some experience in cardiovascular training for at least 6 months somewhat consistently. You should know the basics of cardiovascular training and recognise which modes of training work for you, whether it be running, elliptical or other. With an intermediate level of fitness, you should aim to build on your current level with structured progression. You should aim to increase one factor of your workout by 10% within a specific number of weeks depending on your personal goals and abilities. Aspects of your workout which you can progress is the intensity, duration or frequency. 
            <br><br><b>Types of cardio</b><br><br>Now that you are at an intermediate level, you can personalise your workout tailored to your goals further by choosing a specific type of aerobic training program. 
            <br><br>•	The first one, long slow distance training is where the client trains at a lower intensity from what they are capable of but extends the duration as a result. This form of cardio training focuses on the body’s aerobic capacity and utilizing oxygen efficiently over a prolonged period of time. It is a great way to not only improve your physical endurance but also your mental endurance. During this type of fitness, you should be able to talk without becoming short of breath. 
            <br><br>•	Tempo training is another form of aerobic fitness where you train at 80-90% of your maximum effort for a moderately extended period of time. It should be the maximum pace you can hold for at least 20 minutes. Tempo training is used to train at your lactate threshold, the point where the lactic acid builds up in your muscles faster than your body can clear it away which causes fatigue. Tempo training is a way to increase your body’s ability to sustain higher intensity exercise without having excess lactate accumulate. 
            <br><br>•	The last one, interval training involves alternating bursts of high intensity exercise with lower intensity, recovery periods. Try and have a work-rest ratio of 1:1. This allows the body to accomplish a great amount of work which is normally not possible as it taps into the anaerobic energy systems quickly but allows for a sufficient recovery. This pushes your heart rate limit.

            <br><br>•	The last one, combined aerobic and resistance training is exactly what it says, combining cardio and strength training. This is usually done if you goal is to simultaneously improve both aspects at once. It usually isn’t effective if you just evenly do cardio and strength training every week, but focusing on one area while doing minimum of the other to maintain it, then vice versa is much better.

But static stretching (holding a stretch) is not an effective way to warm up as it does not warm up your muscles well and may reduce temporary range of motion as it is a relaxation stretch.
            <br><br><b>Further tips:</b><br><br>
            <br><br>•	Make sure you stay hydrated and fuel up before a run to provide your body with more energy and nutrients. 
            <br><br>•	Focus on proper form and technique to prevent injury
            <br><br>•	Make sure you get enough rest after workouts, don’t do many workouts in consecutive days and try to space them out across the week. 
            <br><br>•	Set clear goals so you can stay motivated and focused
